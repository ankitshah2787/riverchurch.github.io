sunday</em><strong class="section__title">Jesus is inviting you to a banquet!!<br /></strong><p>Jesus loves you. He wants to bless you. He wants to serve you. I
know it&rsquo;s crazy. The king of the universe wants to serve you.
The root of this desire is God&rsquo;s heart to heal our heart. To
repair and transform a broken relationship. We hope you&rsquo;ll let
Him do that today. Now.
