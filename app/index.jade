          p Jesus is inviting you to a banquet!!
          p Don&rsquo;t we all love a great banquet? I know anytime I&rsquo;ve been invited to a wedding and the host has paid lavish amounts of money so I can eat&mdash;wow, that&rsquo;s the greatest thing ever! The banquet that Jesus invites us to is even better! He loves us. He wants to bless us. He wants to serve us. I know it&rsquo;s crazy. The king of the universe wants to serve me....and you. The root of this desire is God&rsquo;s heart to heal our heart. To repair and transform a broken relationship. I hope you&rsquo;ll let Him do that today.
